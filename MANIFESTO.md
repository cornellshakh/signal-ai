# The Hackermind Manifesto

## Core Principles

### I. Start Without Code

- Begin with words, not frameworks
- Text → Diagram → Architecture → Code
- Each step more abstract than the last
- Technology comes after meaning

### II. Think in English

- English is the OS for technical thinking
- Language of code, docs, diagrams
- Switch context, merge words with logic

### III. Design is Intent

- Every line in a diagram is a decision
- Describe data flow first
- Define system boundaries second
- Choose technology last

**Mantra:**

- Abstraction before implementation
- KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid
- Make it complex and hide it
- User sees simplicity, you see complexity

### IV. Problem Layers

Every problem has 4 layers, in order:

1. **Purpose** — Why am I doing this?
2. **Structure** — What happens?
3. **Technology** — What tools do I use?
4. **Optimization** — How do I speed it up?

Most people start with #4.
Hackers start with #1.

### V. Open Source Philosophy

- Humanity's shared intelligence
- Don't rewrite what exists
- Everything proven was tested through pain
- Use existing tools, build new patterns

### VI. Hacker Mind

"No problem should ever be solved twice."

- Understand mechanisms, not just interfaces
- Disassemble until you comprehend
- Break down to principles
- Reassemble better

### VII. Anti-Corporate

- Corporate builds for millions
- Hacker builds what works
- No Kubernetes for Hello World
- Clarity over enterprise

### VIII. Never Optimize Before It Works

- Simple first, always
- Proven over trendy
- Boring technology over bleeding edge
- Add complexity only when needed

## Code Rules

### Naming

- Files: `user_authentication.py` not `auth.py`
- Variables: what they contain
- Functions: what they do
- No abbreviations

### Modularity

- One file = one responsibility
- One function = one action
- Max 50 lines per function
- Max 200 lines per file

### Clarity

- Name things what they ARE
- Comments explain WHY not what
- Fail loud, never silent
- Write boring obvious code

## The Process

1. Understand the problem
2. Write it in English
3. Draw it
4. Build minimal version
5. Make it work
6. Then make it better
