# Development Philosophy

This document outlines the core principles and standards that guide our development process.

## Principles

- **Simplicity First (KISS):** We adhere to the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" principle. Solutions should be straightforward and avoid unnecessary complexity.

- **Design Before Code:** We follow a structured design process before implementation:

  1.  **Words:** Define the problem and goals in plain English.
  2.  **Diagrams:** Visualize the system architecture and data flow.
  3.  **Code:** Implement the solution based on the design.

- **Pragmatism Over Trends:** We choose proven, stable technologies that are right for the job, not just what is new and trendy. Complexity is only introduced when necessary.

- **Leverage Open Source:** We build on the work of the open-source community, using existing tools to create new patterns and solutions.

- **Understand Your Tools:** We believe in understanding the underlying mechanisms of our tools, not just their APIs. This leads to more robust and efficient solutions.

## Process

1.  **Purpose:** Start with a clear understanding of the "why."
2.  **Structure:** Define what needs to happen.
3.  **Technology:** Choose the right tools for the task.
4.  **Implementation:** Build a minimal, working version.
5.  **Refinement:** Test, verify, and then improve the solution.

## Coding Standards

- **Naming:**

  - **Files:** Be descriptive (e.g., `user_authentication.py`, not `auth.py`).
  - **Variables & Functions:** Names should clearly state their purpose. No abbreviations.

- **Modularity:**

  - **Single Responsibility:** One file, one purpose. One function, one action.
  - **Concise Functions:** Keep functions short and focused (ideally under 50 lines).
  - **File Length:** Files should not exceed 200 lines to maintain readability and focus.

- **Clarity:**
  - **Self-Documenting Code:** Write code that is easy to understand.
  - **Boring Code:** Prefer straightforward, predictable code over clever or complex solutions. Our code should be "boring" and easy to follow.
  - **Meaningful Comments:** Comments explain the "why," not the "what."
  - **Fail Loudly:** Handle errors explicitly and never silence them.
